"""This package contains Blind classifiers, which just uses the output class
values to make predictions by learning a constant function, used information
leakage detection.

We also implement bayes predictor which uses the orignal PDF generating
the datasets to get the predictions. Additonally, Multi Layer Perceptron
is implemented using keras.
