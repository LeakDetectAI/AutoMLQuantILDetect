The ``autoqild`` Python package
=================================
The **AutoMLQuantILDetect** package utilizes AutoML approaches to accurately detect and quantify system information leakage.
We also provide different approaches to estimate **mutual information (MI)** within systems that release classification datasets to quantify system information leakage.
By leveraging state-of-the-art statistical tests, it precisely quantifies mutual information (MI) and effectively detects information leakage within classification datasets.
Users can confidently and comprehensively address the critical challenges of quantification and detection in information leakage analysis.
