The ``autoqild`` package utilizes advanced AutoML tools approaches to detect and quantify system information leakage accurately.
This package estimates mutual information (MI) within systems that release classification datasets. By leveraging state-of-the-art statistical tests, it precisely quantifies mutual information (MI) and effectively detects information leakage within classification datasets.
With AutoMLQuantILDetect, users can confidently and comprehensively address the critical challenges of quantification and detection in the realm of information leakage analysis.
